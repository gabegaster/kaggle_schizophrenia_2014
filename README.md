kaggle_schizophrenia_2014
=========================

Code I used to make my submission for the Kaggle Schizophrenia Classification Challenge 2014

- `winner.py` - My top entry, with 89.6% AUC.
- `make_benchmarks.py` - The script I used to iterate through a bunch of classification pipelines to try out different combinations.
- `utils.py` - Helper functions to load data and write predictions.
